# Call_of_Naafiri
Call of Naafiri is a robot dog project inspired by Naafiri, a dark and powerful darkin character from the League of Legends universe. This project combines Naafiri's wild and leader spirit with a technological artificial intelligence, bringing his unique "Hound of a Hundred Bites" theme to real life.

# High Mobility: 
Designed in accordance with Naafiri's hunter instincts, the robot legs provide agile and fast movement. It can move stably and balanced on different surfaces.

# AI-Supported Capabilities: 
Advanced artificial intelligence algorithms were designed inspired by Naafiri's "Call of the Pack" ability. These algorithms allow the robot dog to react sensitively to environmental interactions.

# Sound and Image Recognition: 
Thanks to integrated sound and image recognition modules, Naafiri's Iron Hound can perceive sounds and images around it and respond appropriately to them.

# Autonomous and Remote Control: 
The robot can move on its own in autonomous mode, or it can act in accordance with commands by being controlled remotely.

# Interactive Behaviors: 
Reflecting Naafiri's leadership qualities, the robot dog can work in groups and interact with other robots or people/objects around it.

# Advanced Sensors: 
Equipped with various sensors, Naafiri's Iron Hound can detect environmental factors such as temperature, distance, and movement and adjust its movements accordingly.

# Durable Design: 
True to the "Hounds of Iron" theme, the robot is made of sturdy and durable materials, making it resistant to harsh environmental conditions.

# Modular Structure: 
The robot's hardware and software components are designed in a modular structure, making it easy to add new features or upgrade existing components.

# Dynamic LED Lighting: 
Reflecting Naafiri's dark and wild style, dynamic LED lighting changes color according to the robot's different modes and situations.
